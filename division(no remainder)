// When you first learned to divide, you expressed answers using a quotient and a remainder. for example, if you divide 7 by 2, your answer would be given as 3 r.1. Given 2 integers, divide the largest number by the smallest number. For example, the user may input 2 then 7. Your program should display the same result. (e) Do the same problem as 1d), but if there is no remainder, do not include “r. 0”.

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

  // declaring variables

  int dInput1;  // these should be ints
  int dInput2;
  int dQuotient;
  int dRemainder = 0; // it needs to have an initial condition because what if the program executes and never meets the conditions of your if statements
    
    // user input 
    Scanner sin = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Input the two numbers");
    dInput1 = sin.nextInt();
    dInput2 = sin.nextInt();

      // if statements 
      if (dInput1> dInput2){
      
      dQuotient = dInput1/dInput2;
      dRemainder = dInput1 % dInput2;

      System.out.println("the quotient is " + dQuotient + " and the remainder is " +dRemainder);

      }

      else if (dInput2>dInput1){

      dQuotient = dInput2/dInput1;
      dRemainder = dInput2 % dInput1;
      
      System.out.println("the quotient is " + dQuotient + "the remainder is " + dRemainder);
